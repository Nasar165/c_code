# GDB
A tool for debugging c code. It will require some minor command to get it working.

#commands
q = quit.
c = continue without breaking.
push enter = move to next breakpoint.
!clear = clear the terminal.
run = run code.

# GCC compiler 
add -g to allow debugging.
sample gcc -g main.c -o a.out

# view c code 
type <list> to show all the code.
to view specific lines type <list rownr,rownr> sample: list 13,15

# add breakpoint and view them
b <function> sample: b myFunction
b <row number> sample b 12 this will add a break point at row 12
To view breakpoints type <info b>
delete a breakpoint use d <id> sample d 1

# Running the code 
gdb ./a.out

# Show assembly code
<disass> the code must be running using the run command.

# Move to the next instruction 
nexti the code will move one step.

# keep showing the value of a var
display <varname> sample display counter

# show a value or memory location of a variable 
print <varname> sample print &counter will print the memory location of the counter.

# Show threads 
info threads 
thread <id> to switch between threads. Sample thread 1 or thread 3

# Stop at certain events
<watch> <variable> <operator> <value> sample: watch counter == 4500
