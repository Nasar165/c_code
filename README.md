## Introduction
A project that was aimed at myself where i practiced C programing. The goal was to move down in the 
technology ladder to low level programing. I wish to program my own hardware in the future so that 
I can develop IoT devices. Any one who wishes to read contribute or review the code and provide
suggestion is welcome to do so.

### Getting started
Welcome to my practice repository where i have stored some easy simple C code that you can 
view copy run or edit for what every reason you may wish. The setup of the project is 
really easy and you won't need much time to get up and running. All you need to run the 
code is [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and two commands if you are running linux.
The commands are gcc <filename> and ./a.out and the c code will run.

There are play of gcc command that you can play with so make sure to visit gcc's manual 
and play around with the commands. Just make sure to read the docs properly before.

### Prerequisites
The get everything running smoothy without any hiccups will requires some tools they might 
come preinstalled with your OS and if not I have listed the tools you will need to run C code
on your machine.

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) - C Compiler
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) - Version Control

And then lastly a text editor of your choosing I recommend VS code but any text editor will do.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code Editor

### Built With

The practice C code was built with the following tools on GNU/Linux with Fedora 32 
as distribution.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code Editor
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) - C Compiler
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) - Version Control
- [Github](https://github.com/) - Version Control provider
